    - What errors were occuring and how they might be caused / fixed
    - General roadmapping of how to complete the project.


5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
    - Nothing more than the standard handtrack js npm install should be needed, but the updating process
    and downloading of files can be tricky.


--Aim for no more than two sentences for each of the following questions.--


6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
    - The original concept of the app was to be developed in such to simulate owning a pet at a petstore of sorts.
    As a result, we were designing it with future potential pet owners in mind.

7. Describe the two custom gestures you created.
    - NO custom gestures were implemented due to time constraints.

8. How does your app implement or follow principles of good UI design?
    - Asides from following intuitive button placements (FAB's with recognizable logos [i for information]),
    alerts were used to make sure the user understands and interacts with results and events chronilogically.
